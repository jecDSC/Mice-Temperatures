        Research Question: How does temperature fluctuate throughout the day
        when the female mice are on/off their period?

        <h2>Main Graph</h2>

        <div id="vis"></div>

        <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
        <p>
          The color of the respective temperature lines is deliberate, many
          people associate the color blue with male and pink with female.
          Additionally, each portion of the graph displays whether it is "day"
          (lights on) or "night" (lights off) by highlighting the portions with
          light on as yellow and liught off as grey. This is so that viewers of
          the plot would be able to compare the differences in temperatures from
          day and night with just a look, without needing to know context about
          the dataset. Additionally, We implemeneted the same feature but
          applied to the females' ovulation period. This was done in a red shade
          since it thematically relates to females. <br /><br />
          We also implemented a couple interactive elements, including brushing
          and tooltips. Users will be able to highlight a portion of the graph
          that they want more details on, displaying the average body
          temperatures over the duration, the time, if the lights are on, and
          status on ovulation. Additionally, tooltips will allow for the user to
          click on any part of the lineplot they want and see the value of the
          average temperature of all mice of that gender in the hour, the time,
          if the lights are on or off, and the status on ovulation.

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        We met as three to discuss the project and our ideas for it initially,
        with all three of us putting in equal work to get to that idea. We then
        divided our efforts: Jeremy worked mostly on the visualization, Elvin
        worked on the styling of the site, and Vincent worked mostly on the site
        and the writeup. We spent around 2 hours each on this project, with the
        most time consuming portion being the planning and brainstorming at the
        beginning.
