        Research Question: How does the estrus period in female mice affect the
        average difference in core temperature between male and female mice?

        <h2>Main Graph</h2>

        <div id="vis"></div>

        <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
        <p>
          The color of the respective temperature lines is deliberate, many
          people associate the color blue with male and pink with female.
          Additionally, each portion of the graph displays whether the female
          mice are in the estrus period or not by highlighting the portions
          where they are with gray, and leaving the rest of the background
          unchanged. This is so that viewers of the plot would be able to
          compare the differences in temperatures between estrus days and normal
          days with just a look, without needing to know context about the
          dataset.
          <br /><br />
          We also implemented an interactive element: tooltips. Users will be
          able to highlight a portion of the graph that they want more details
          on, displaying the average body temperatures over the duration, the
          time, if the lights are on, and status on ovulation. Additionally,
          tooltips will allow for the user to click on any part of the lineplot
          they want and see the value of the average temperature of all mice of
          that gender in the hour, the time, if the lights are on or off, and
          the status on ovulation.

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        We met as three to discuss the project and our ideas for it initially,
        with all three of us putting in equal work to get to that idea. We then
        divided our efforts: Jeremy worked mostly on the visualization, Elvin
        worked on the styling of the site, and Vincent worked mostly on the site
        and the writeup. We spent around 2 hours each on this project, with the
        most time consuming portion being the planning and brainstorming at the
        beginning.
