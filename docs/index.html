        Research Question: How does the estrus period in female mice affect the
        average difference in core temperature between male and female mice?

        <h2>Main Graph</h2>

        <div id="vis"></div>

        <div id="sub_vis"></div>
        <p>
          It seems like average core temperature differences are at the highest
          when female mice are in their estrus period.
        </p>

        <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
        <p>
          We chose this research question because it was established by the
          dataset description that the estrus period in female mice correlates
          to higher body temperature in females, but we wanted to explore how
          significant that temperature rise is when compared to male mice.
          <br /><br />
          We decided that a line graph would be best for this visualization,
          since the temperature of the mice was a quantitative continuous
          variable. The line graph would also enable us to easily visualize the
          change of average mice temperatures over time. We considered if we
          should add in indicators for whether light was on or off in the mice's
          environments, but decided not to add it in since it had little
          relevance in the question we wanted to explore.
          <br /><br />
          The color of the respective temperature lines is deliberate, since
          many people associate the color blue with male and pink with female.
          Additionally, each portion of the graph displays whether the female
          mice are in the estrus period or not by highlighting the portions
          where they are with gray, and leaving the rest of the background
          unchanged. This is so that viewers of the plot would be able to
          compare the differences in temperatures between estrus days and normal
          days with just a look, without needing to know context about the
          dataset.
          <br /><br />
          We also created a sub-plot solely dedicated to the differece between
          the two groups over time, since that is our primary interest in the
          dataset. This helps users easily see where the peak differences occur,
          rather than leaving them to compare the two lines of the main
          visualization to observe the difference over time.
          <br /><br />
          We implemented tooltips as our interactive element. Users will be able
          to hover over a portion of the graph that they want more details on.
          This will display the average body temperatures for males and females
          at that specific minute, the time, and the difference between the two.
          The sub-visualization's tooptip works similarly, showing the time and
          difference between the two groups. With these tooltips, users can see
          the numeric data for instances of time, and this is especially helpful
          for seeing the exact values where the peak differences occur, which,
          according to our visualizations, seems to be during the female mice's
          estrus period.

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        We met as three to discuss the project and our ideas for it initially,
        with all three of us putting in equal work to get to that idea. We then
        divided our efforts. Jeremy worked on the process of creating the
        visualization through D3, Elvin was responsible for the interactables
        and styling, and Vincent working mostly on the writeup, site, and
        leading the initial dataset exploration. Throughout the process, we were
        very much in close communications. We discussed almost every detail with
        each other to make sure we were on the same page as a team.
        Collectively, we each put around 3-4 hours on the project. We started
        with several crude visualizations created by using the dataset. The
        graph below was one of our creations, and it inspired us to narrow down
        our question to what we have now.
        <br />
        <img
          src="../imgs/lineavgfm12.png"
          alt="Placeholder"
          class="development"
        />
        <br />
        Since displaying all 20160 rows would make the visualization unreadable,
        we tried narrowing down the scale. First, we decided to display hourly
        data, and we came up with this as a prototype.
        <br />
        <iframe
          src="./development_graphs/hourly.html"
          width="1000"
          height="600"
          frameborder="0"
        ></iframe>
        <br />
        Then, a groupmember wanted to see what the data would look like if we
        displayed the data by minutes instead of hours, and we got this.
        <br />
        <iframe
          src="./development_graphs/minutes.html"
          width="1000"
          height="600"
          frameborder="0"
        ></iframe>
        <br />
        We talked about what unit of time we should use for a bit, then decided
        that if we narrow down the minutes displayed, we can provide a detailed
        visualization while making it readable. We decided that the first six
        days of data should suffice, since this time period included two estrus
        periods for female mice. After this, we got to work on our assigned
        parts, and eventually created our two interactable visualizations.
